| September 11 | 12:50pm-1:20pm  | Initially, I was thinking of things in java we haven't learned yet. I have heard about a linked list, where I'm pretty sure each item points to the item behind and infront of it. Now that I think about it more I'm not sure it will help at all. I'm gonna try to think more big picture and not get stuck in details like I did with snakes and ladders. Think more about the skeleton of the problem I guess. I would solve this by looking at which cities are all connected and put one hospital there. Then, I will look at the bridges and delete the ones I don't need. |

This problem also reminds me of graph theory because I see nodes and edges and stuff. OH maybe if we lay down all the bridges we can see which cities are connected and then we just need one hospital per connected area and I could have an algorithm to delete any redundant bridges! Each group of cities only needs n-1 bridges |

The first first value is the amount of tests, the first val is the number of cities, the second is the number of potential bridges, the third is the hospital cost, the fourth is the highway cost, and the 2 number lists are the potential highways. I think the only thing I need to do is just find out how many city groups there are and from there, I only need one hospital per group and n-1 highways per group |

I do wonder if a possible case is that a city is isolated and needs a city. |

I've been just thinking of ways to do the alogrithm but I can't think of anything that would work. Because I need to keep track of the cities in clumps to determine which aren't and I would need to loop over which cities aren't in clumps and i feel it would be inefficient. |

I was thinking of an 2d arraylist but that seems incredibly inefficient so I don't know what to really do. I think next time we do a v1 I wonder if its better to just put down a really inefficient program first or to brainstorm more like what I'm doing. |
