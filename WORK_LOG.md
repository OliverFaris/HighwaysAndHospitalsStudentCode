| September 11 | 12:50pm-1:20pm  | Initially, I was thinking of things in java we haven't learned yet. I have heard about a linked list, where I'm pretty sure each item points to the item behind and infront of it. Now that I think about it more I'm not sure it will help at all. I'm gonna try to think more big picture and not get stuck in details like I did with snakes and ladders. Think more about the skeleton of the problem I guess. I would solve this by looking at which cities are all connected and put one hospital there. Then, I will look at the bridges and delete the ones I don't need. |

This problem also reminds me of graph theory because I see nodes and edges and stuff. OH maybe if we lay down all the bridges we can see which cities are connected and then we just need one hospital per connected area and I could have an algorithm to delete any redundant bridges! Each group of cities only needs n-1 bridges |

The first first value is the amount of tests, the first val is the number of cities, the second is the number of potential bridges, the third is the hospital cost, the fourth is the highway cost, and the 2 number lists are the potential highways. I think the only thing I need to do is just find out how many city groups there are and from there, I only need one hospital per group and n-1 highways per group |

I do wonder if a possible case is that a city is isolated and needs a city. |

I've been just thinking of ways to do the alogrithm but I can't think of anything that would work. Because I need to keep track of the cities in clumps to determine which aren't and I would need to loop over which cities aren't in clumps and i feel it would be inefficient. |

I was thinking of an 2d arraylist but that seems incredibly inefficient so I don't know what to really do. I think next time we do a v1 I wonder if its better to just put down a really inefficient program first or to brainstorm more like what I'm doing. |

First I was looking at the non-sped up one before so I know exactly what parts the sped-up parts actually speed up. Overall, just want to get a better understanding of how this algorithm works so I can implement it better. |

I used the pseudocode from the slides to help me and eventually I got a working version. I also realized I needed the nodes array to be n+1 length in order to maintain the numbers. |

I had some problems a long the way because I realized after a while I also needed to compress the paths of the second node too. I was also understanding the pseudocode much better and at this point I knew how everything worked together. |

I initially thought that I was putting in the negative values in the while loops above when I figured out that all of the weight balancing logic happens within the union step. So, with that I split it up into cases and added weights to roots depending on if they had a larger order than the other root. I think I explained that badly, its easier to explain with words + seeing the code too. |
